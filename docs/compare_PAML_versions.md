xxx how different are results from paml4.9j (new docker) compared to 4.9a (old docker)?  and compare to v4.8 (old runs outside docker)?

compare overall M8 pvalue as well as BEB results


# Abo, with user tree

This was a case where there were NANs in the BEB output.

4.9j versus 4.9a:  the maximum likelihood and p-values are the same. The BEB is different - 4.9j did find one site where BEB>0.9 and 4.9a found none
