# Issues still to fix

## Fixes since v1.0.7

Nov 1 2022:
- fixed a bug in `pw_plottree.R` that messed up taxon names when making pdf plots of the trees (does not affect PAML output, only the tree plots)
- make the omega plots look a tiny bit nicer, and added clear indication on the plot that we're not showing the full range of omega in some cases
- changed a column header in the tsv outputs:  was 'seqToWhichSiteCoordsRefer', now 'seqToWhichAminoAcidsRefer'
